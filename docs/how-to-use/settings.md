# ⚙️ Settings Categories

- For familiarity, Settings are grouped in a similar way as seen on Pinecil (and as organized in Ralim's IronOS firmware).
- Categories can be clicked to collapse and reduce screen clutter.
- Setting numbers can be changed two ways: moving the slider or simply typing on the box next to the slider.
- Drop-down menus are used for clarity of text choices.
- Toggle choices are used for all check box items ☑️ seen on the pinecil (e.g. detailed idle).
